The goal of matchmaker is to provide dictionary-based cleaning for R users in a
simple and intuitive manner built on the {forcats} package. Some of the features
of this package include:

 - preservation of factor orders
 - ability to specify explicit and implicit missing values
 - option to replace by fuzzy matching (regular expressions, anchored by default)
 - optional variable selection by fuzzy matching

## Installation

You can install the development version of matchmaker from GitHub with:
