The goal of {matchmaker} is to provide dictionary-based cleaning for R users in
a simple and intuitive manner built on the
[{forcats}](https://forcats.tidyverse.org) package. Some of the features of
this package include:

 - preservation of factor orders
 - ability to specify explicit and implicit missing values
 - option to replace by fuzzy matching (regular expressions, anchored by default)
 - optional variable selection by fuzzy matching

## Installation

You can install {matchmaker} from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("matchmaker")
```
