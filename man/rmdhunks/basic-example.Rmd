## Example

The matchmaker package has two user-facing functions that perform dictionary-based cleaning:


 - `match_vec()` will translate the values in a single vector
 - `match_df()` will translate values in all specified columns of a data frame 
 
Mostly, users will be working with `match_df()` to transform values across
specific columns. This is what a typical workflow would look like:

```{r setup}
library("matchmaker")

# Read in data set
dat <- read.csv(matchmaker_example("coded-data.csv"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
dat$date <- as.Date(dat$date)

# Read in dictionary
dict <- read.csv(matchmaker_example("spelling-dictionary.csv"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

```{r example}
# Clean spelling based on dictionary -----------------------------

dict # show the dict
head(dat) # show the data

cleaned <- match_df(dat,
  dictionary = dict,
  from = "options",
  to = "values",
  by = "grp"
)
head(cleaned)
```
